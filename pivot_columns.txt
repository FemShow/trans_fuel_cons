This comprehensive data preprocessing workflow performs the following tasks:
    1. Reads an Excel file containing multiple worksheets.
    2. Processes each worksheet according to specific rules, such as renaming columns, adding new columns, and formatting data.
    3. Merges the processed data from all worksheets into a single DataFrame.
    4. Melts the DataFrame to create a long format suitable for analysis.
    5. Adds additional columns ('measures' and 'units') based on the suffix of the 'age_band' column.
    6. Processes the 'age_band' and 'observations' columns to standardize their values and formats.
    7. Saves the processed data to a CSV file for further analysis.
Data Acquisition:
        ◦ Read the Excel file containing the regional employment data by age.
        ◦ Identify the names of all worksheets within the Excel file.
    2. Worksheet Processing:
        ◦ For each worksheet:
            ▪ Exclude any sheets designated for summary, notes, index, or other non-data purposes.
            ▪ Extract relevant information:
                • Strip the last two characters of the worksheet name to determine the region.
                • Extract suffix from the worksheet name to determine the sex category.
                • Read the data into a pandas DataFrame, skipping irrelevant rows and specifying column headers.
                • Add columns for 'ons_geography_code' and 'sex' based on the extracted region and sex category.
                • Add a column for 'region' with the appropriate value derived from the worksheet name.
                • Rename the first column to 'time_period' and format the time period.
                • Append the processed DataFrame to a list for concatenation later.
    3. Data Concatenation:
        ◦ Concatenate all DataFrames obtained from the previous step into a single DataFrame.
    4. Column Renaming:
        ◦ Rename columns based on a predefined dictionary mapping original column names to standardized names.(This renaming these columns is to create an opportunity to differentiate between numbers (_num) and percentages (_perc))
    5. Data Transformation:
        ◦ Melt the DataFrame to convert wide format to long format, facilitating further analysis.
        ◦ Add a 'measures' column based on the suffix of the 'age_band' column.
        ◦ Add a 'units' column based on the suffix of the 'age_band' column.
    6. Data Cleaning:
        ◦ Iterate through the DataFrame to process 'age_band' and 'observations':
            ▪ Remove suffixes '_num' and '_perc' from the 'age_band' column values.
            ▪ Round 'observations' to two decimal places if it's a float value.
            ▪ Replace '*' with 0 in 'observations' column.
    7. Data Export:
        ◦ Save the preprocessed data to a CSV file for further analysis.
This workflow ensures that the data from multiple worksheets are standardized and consolidated into a cohesive dataset, ready for analysis or further processing.
